ContentSquare Data Science Test
===========
## Goal
The goal of the exercise is to predict the category of a webpage based on its URL string and custom variables.

## Instructions
* You should not spend more than 5 hours working on the test. We're aware that it's not enough to fully answer the 
problem, but that's OK. This is done on purpose and we don't expect you to finish the exercise
* To get started using the dataset you can refer to the [getting started notebook](getting_started.ipynb)
* You're encouraged to use comments to describe the steps you're taking and explain your code
* If you use external libraries please make sure to list them in a `requirements.txt` file
* Provide a `README.md` explaining what you did and specifying which code to run to reproduce your results
* Submission should include all your scripts/notebooks as well as the `requirements.txt` and `README.md` files

## Assessment
We will assess the exercise based on the following criteria
* Depth and quality of the scientific approach
* Code quality and cleanliness
* Logic and relevance of your chosen steps
* Clarity of the comments and README

## Expectations
This test is part of a project that we are working on since several months. As a result, we don't expect from you to 
find a working solution. Depending on how you think you will manage your time, you can either:
* craft an end to end solution (business anaylsis, training data analysis, modeling and training, results interpretation) and iterate on it
* or choose some sections only and produce an in-depth analysis.

As a result, training a machine learning model is not a requirement to succeed the test. However if you don't train a model, tell us how you would do it. The most important criteria is that what you produce is relevant and right even if it's partial or not comprehensive.
